# ToDo List

## HomePage: [ ] 
Hero Section (Above the Fold)

    Background: A dark, eerie animated scene (e.g., a haunted forest, flickering lights, fog effect).
    Main Title: “Welcome to the Unknown” (or something ominous).
    Subtitle: “Dare to enter? The horrors within await.”
    Call-to-Action (CTA) Buttons:
        “Read a Story” (Leads to the Horror Stories section)
        “Enter the Darkness” (Takes users to a random page with a surprise horror effect)


### Interactive Horror Effect

    A ghostly whisper sound or a shadow figure appearing as users scroll.
    Mouse-follow effects: Eyes that seem to follow the cursor or text that distorts when hovered.


### Footer

    Creepy farewell message: “You can leave… but the horrors will follow.”
    Social Media Links (stylized as cursed runes or symbols).

### Extra Ideas

    Dark Mode Only (or an even darker “Nightmare Mode”).
    Countdown Timer to a special horror event or secret page reveal.
    A “Don’t Click This” button that leads to a creepy interactive experience.
